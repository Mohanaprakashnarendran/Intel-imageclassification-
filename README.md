INTEL Image Classification using cnn algorithm
This project utilizes TensorFlow to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The dataset used contains images from different categories such as buildings, forests, mountains, etc.

Setup
1.Dependencies:

TensorFlow
scikit-learn
matplotlib
OpenCV
2.Dataset:

Download the dataset from the provided link.
The dataset should have a directory structure with separate folders for training and testing images.
3.Model:

•The CNN model consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and dense layers.
•Data augmentation techniques such as random flips and rotations are applied to improve generalization.
•The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
Training
1.Data Preprocessing:

•Load and preprocess the training and testing datasets.
•Perform shuffling, caching, and prefetching for improved performance.
2.Model Training:

•Train the model using the training dataset for a specified number of epochs.
•Monitor training and validation accuracy and loss.
3.Visualization:

•Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss curves using Matplotlib.

Evaluation
1.Model Evaluation:

•Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset.
•Print the accuracy achieved on the testing dataset.
2.Prediction:

•Load an image for prediction.
•Preprocess the image and make predictions using the trained model.
•Display the predicted class and confidence level on the image.

Usage
1.Training:

•Execute the provided script to train the model.
